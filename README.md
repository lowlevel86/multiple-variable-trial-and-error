# multiple-variable-trial-and-error
mvtrialanderror.py contains 3 main useful functions

guessValues() guesses and finds values based on input

generateValues() can generate multiple values within a range without hitting the same value combination twice, it can also start where it left off without having to start from the first iteration  
This function is demonstrated in outputValues.py.
